We are responsible for our own content on these pages according to general laws in Germany. However, we are not obligated to monitor third-party information sent to or saved on our website or to investigate any circumstances that indicate any illegal activity. This shall not affect our obligations under general laws to remove or block the use of information. However, we can assume liability for taking such action only from the time we receive knowledge of a specific legal violation or infringement of rights. We will remove such content from our website as soon as possible after we receive knowledge of any respective legal violations or infringement of rights by said information.

Upon receiving knowledge of such legal violations or infringement of rights, we will remove these links as soon as possible.
